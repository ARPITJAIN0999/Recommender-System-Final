# CSI_WIP3_DATAMAPPERS
CSI (Computer Society of India) WIP-3.0. Team-DataMappers (Aditya Raj, Aaryaman Sharma, Arpit Jain).
This repository is for the project submission of CSI Winter Internship Program 3.0.

We have uploaded the detailed explanation of the RRS in the PDF file.

We have uploaded all the components required to execute this project including the MovieLens.csv file as the dataset.

Recommender System

Recommender System is a system that seeks to predict or filter preferences according to the user’s choices. Recommender systems are utilized in a variety of areas including movies, music, news, books, research articles, search queries, social tags, and products, in general. A more formal definition of recommendation systems would be, it is a subclass of information filtering system that seeks to predict the “rating” or “preference” a user would give to an item.

#Workflow:-

Step 1. Collecting data.

Step 2. Storing of data.

Step 3. Analyzing the data.

Step 4. Filtering the data into train and test set.

Step 5. Apply SVD (Singular Value Decomposition) Algorithm on Train Set.

Step 6. Get top N Recommenndation.

Step 7. Analyse RSME and MAE.

#Main Driver Function:-
1. MainTopN.py        ( Executing this files produces TopN recommendation using SVD+KNN algo among with a Random algo for comparision. )
2. AccuracyClass.py   ( Executing this files produces RSME and MAE to get accuracy. ) 

#Software required to execute files:-
1. Python 3 
2. Spyder ( Anaconda )

#Library needed to be installed:-
1. Surprise ( scikit-learn )
